# PolynomialTask (Day 5, Task 1)

## Task description

The task is to implement a sealed class `Polynomial` which will incapsulate a polynomial from a real variable.
`Polynomial` class is to be integrated into C# by properly overloading `object` virtual methods and implementing
algebraic operations on `Polynomial` (except polynomial divison).
