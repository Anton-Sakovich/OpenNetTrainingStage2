# BubbleTask (Day 5, Task 2)

## Task description

The task is to implement bubble sort algorithm for rows of matrix. The matrix is represented as a ragged array of integers.
The algorithm must be able to sort matrix rows using both ascending and descending order, and using different soring criteria:

1. In ascending  (descending) order of maximal element in each row;
2. In ascending  (descending) order of minimal element in each row;
3. In ascending  (descending) order of sum of the rows elements.
